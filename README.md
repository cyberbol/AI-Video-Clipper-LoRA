## 🚀 How to Use

### 🎥 1. Auto-Clipper
Upload a video, set your **Project Name**, and let the AI find the perfect segments based on speech. It will cut the video and describe each clip automatically.

### 📝 2. Bulk Video Captioner (New!)
If you already have a folder full of video clips (from other tools or manual cutting), use this mode. Select the folder, and the AI will generate `.txt` files for every video using the Vision model.

### 🖼️ 3. Image Folder Captioner
Standard mode for bulk-captioning images for LoRA training.
